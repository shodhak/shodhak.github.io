Experience</span>**

**Yale University** May 2017 - Present

*Postdoctoral Associate*

-   Implemented data science methods like Regression, Monte Carlo
    simulations and Market Basket analysis to a dataset of 37,000
    clinical isolates, and identified novel patterns of serotype
    replacement in *Streptococcus pneumoniae.*

-   NGS analysis from microbial cultures in competition to assess
    genomic variants and identify genes that regulate polysaccharide
    capsule composition and structure.

-   Built shiny apps and generated R markdown documents to communicate
    research findings to the group and collaborators.

**University of Kentucky** Aug 2011 – May 2017

*PhD* (GPA: 3.7/4.0; GRE: 740Q, 560V)

-   **Thesis Project**: Applied statistical methods like multiple
    regression, principal component analysis, outlier analysis to
    identify novel candidate genes affecting sleep. Performed Bayesian
    imputation in a dataset with more than 34 million observations
    collected from nearly 10 thousand mice, and implemented decision
    tree and random forest algorithms to identify key predictors of
    sleep behavior.

    **Publications**: 1. Identifying candidate genes for variation in
    sleep related quantitative traits. (Published Poster Abstract, Sept
    2014, BMC Bioinformatics) 2. Piezo system identifies genes
    influencing sleep from KOMP2 pipeline with a high hit rate.

-   **Business**: Worked with team at Signal solutions LLC to optimize
    piezoelectric sleep wake monitoring system for mice. Provided
    troubleshooting and experimental design support to labs using the
    technology, and provided inputs in algorithm development. Presented
    the technology and novel findings at international meetings and
    conferences.

    **Journal Article**: Increased fragmentation of sleep-wake cycles in
    the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease. (Published: April
    2015, Journal of Neuroscience)

-   **Consulting**: Conducted literature survey, provided inputs on
    study design, and performed data analysis for a human study
    conducted to assess the new air conditioning product at Big Ass
    Solutions LLC.

    **Review Paper**: The importance of temperature and thermoregulation
    for optimal sleep. (Journal of Energy and Buildings)

-   **Project Management**: Conducted a study to assess the effect of
    meditation on performance. Authored successful grant application and
    IRB protocol to collect performance and EEG measures from subjects.
    Recruited 30 subjects and mentored and supervised 3 undergraduate
    students as part of the project.

    **Journal Article**: EEG and Reaction Time profiling in novice
    meditators. (Manuscript under preparation)

-   **Teaching**: Conducted practical lab courses in physiology,
    evolution, scientific research, and introductory biology for more
    than 400 students thus far composed of biology majors and
    non-majors.

    Programming, Correlation and Regression, Statistical Genetics,
    Multivariate Methods, Biometry, Machine Learning, Medical
    Informatics

**Advanced Center for Treatment, Education & Research in Cancer
(ACTREC)** Sep 2009 – Jan 2011

*Research Assistant*

-   Performed immunohistochemistry on patient tumor samples and
    collected expression data for cytokeratin protein biomarkers.

-   Conducted survival and sensitivity analyses to assess the prognostic
    value and their role as prognostic markers in human oral pre-cancer
    and cancer.

-   **Publications:** 1. Prognostic value of tissue polypeptide antigen
    in oral squamous cell carcinoma. (Feb 2011, Oral Oncology) 2.
    Prognostic role of Oct4, CD44 and c-Myc in radio-chemo-resistant
    oral cancer patients and their tumourigenic potential in
    immunodeficient mice. (Apr 2015, Clinical Oral Investigations)
