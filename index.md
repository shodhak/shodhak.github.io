I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale School of Public Health, where I work in the lab of [Dr. Daniel Weinberger](https://publichealth.yale.edu/people/daniel_weinberger-2.profile). I am a computational biologist with substantial benchwork experience in molecular biology. In my current research, I analyze genomic, epidemiological and biochemical data for pneumonia causing bacteria _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ to identify predictors regulating the patterns of serotype switching and replacement. Previously, I did my PhD under the guidance of Dr. Bruce O'Hara at the University of Kentucky. My thesis project involved working on data from a large scale phenotyping study called Kockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP<sup>2</sup>). I implemented statistical and machine learning methods to identify genetic and phenotypic predictors affecting sleep behavior in mice. I have my masters degree in Bioinformatics and undergraduate degree in  Microbiology. Throughout my career, I have worked in diverse research areas ranging from microbiology, neuroscience, plant pathology, and cancer biology. I also have experience in teaching, publishing and consulting. This website will give you a glimpse into my work experience.
