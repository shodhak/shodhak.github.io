I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale School of Public Health, where I work with Dr. Daniel Weinberger. I am a trained
computational and molecular biologist. In my current research, I analyze genomic, epidemiological and biochemical data 
for pneumonia to identify patterns of serotype switching and replacement in the microorganism _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.
