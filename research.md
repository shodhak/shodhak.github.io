### Patterns of serotype switching and replacement in _Pneumococcus_
As a bioinformatics postdoc, I am currently working on a project to identify non-random serotype switching patterns observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are more than 90 serotypes observed in nature for this bacterium, several of which are invasive and cause diseases in both children and adults. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) target these invasive serotypes, which has led to increase in carriage of non-vaccine serotypes. This replacement is mostly driven by recombination which sometimes leads to switching of serotypes from vaccine-targeted to vaccine-escaping, while maintaining their invasiveness. I am using a database of more than 37000 clinical isolates and using analytic methods like Monte Carlo simulations and Market Basket Analysis to identify novel serotype switching patterns. To identify genes and pathways that might provide mechanistic insight into this phenomenon, our lab has collected whole genome sequences from different serotypes. To analyze this data, I have written NGS pipelines for variant calling and have parallelized the code to increase speed and efficiency.
